 * Guarding state with a private lock
 * take care private final Object obj = new Object();
 * Making the lock object private encapsulates the lock so that client code cannot acquire it,
 * whereas a publicly accessible lock allows client code to participate in its synchronization policy-correctly or incorrectly.
 * Clients that improperly acquire another objectâ€™s lock could cause liveness problems,
 * and verifying that a publicly accessible lock is properly used requires examining the entire program rather than a single class.
